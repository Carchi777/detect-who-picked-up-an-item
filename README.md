# introduction
This scripts is made to detect when the player picks up an item.

# How does it work?

this uses the entityRemoved before event and checks if the entity is an item.
Right after it looks for players in a 1.5 radius area and checks their inventory before and after the item gets picked up.
When the player's inventory has a new item and matches the item that got picked it fires and warns the console that the item got picked up by that player.
